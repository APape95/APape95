# Hi, I'm Amy ðŸ‘‹  
*(She/Her)*  

I am a Data Analyst with expertise in **SQL, Python, and data visualisation**, currently working as a Statistician Data Analyst at Worldpay. I specialise in turning complex datasets into **clear, actionable insights** for stakeholders at all levels, from operational teams to board committees.  

My background in customer service, account management, and debt analytics means I combine **technical capability with strong communication skills**, making data accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.  

I am particularly interested in **business intelligence, workflow optimisation, and regulatory/compliance data analysis**, with a proven record of improving processes and enabling self-service analytics.
